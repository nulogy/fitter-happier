FitterHappier
=============

FitterHappier provides actions for monitoring a rails site and database availability. FitterHappier's monitoring controller disables unnecessary Rails features, like sessions, layouts, and logging, for lightning-fast monitoring URIs.  

FitterHappier provides three monitoring URIs

    FitterHappier Site and Database Check Passed @ Wed, 17 Dec 2008 14:27:57 -0800
    Schema Version: 20081217141904
